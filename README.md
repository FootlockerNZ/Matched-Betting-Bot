# Matched Betting Bot

## Overview

This Discord-integrated matched betting bot helps users find high-value betting opportunities (called **conversions**) and perform quick profitability calculations. It automates the process of identifying profitable bets using back and lay odds, while also supporting currency conversion between AUD and NZD.

---

## What is a Conversion?

A **conversion** in matched betting represents the expected retained value (as a percentage) from a bonus bet after placing a corresponding lay bet. There are two main types:

- **SNR (Stake Not Returned)**: Used for bonus bets where the stake isn't returned in winnings.
- **SR (Stake Returned)**: Used for standard bets where the stake is returned upon winning.

Higher conversion percentages indicate more profitable matched betting opportunities.
